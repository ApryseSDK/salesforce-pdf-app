# Salesforce PDF App

A sample WebViewer app built for Salesforce. Showcases end-to-end use cases for search, redaction and replacing content, to be used for demo purposes/example in the documentation.

## Installation

First, download and unpack the repository. You need to install VS Code and install the `Salesforce Extension Pack` from your Extensions. Open up the folder in VS Code and authenticate your desired target org. You can right-click on your `force-app/main/default` folder and click on `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org`. 

Once you have completed the deployment, log into your org, and navigate to a record page. Click the setup, then click on `Edit Page`. Finally, drag and drop the `pdftronWebviewerContainer` component onto the record page. Then click `Save` - make sure to set the page as default as well.
